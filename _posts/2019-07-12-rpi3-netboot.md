# Overview

Here's an overview of the setup made for booting a Raspberry Pi over
network. Goal was to achieve boot using boot partition and root
partition from a development machine, in order to speed up test process
for trying out subsequent Buildroot stuff, as well as the modifications
on the Raspbian image.

Aim here was to have a successful boot, and be able to SSH to the RPi.

# HW/SW Setup Outline

1.  Have a Raspberry Pi connected over ETH directly to the PC running
    Windows.
2.  Have a VirtualBox virtual machine running a Linux distro with
    TFTP/NFS servers brought up.
3.  Connect to the RPi serial port with serial to USB adapter to monitor
    the boot process.
4.  For powering up RPi, use USB power meter to monitor the state of the
    device.

Here's the photo of the hardware setup -

## Concrete Versions

|Item                       |Value
|---                        |---
|Host OS                    |Windows 10
|Guest OS                   |Xubuntu 18.04.2 LTS
|RPi                        |Raspberry Pi Model 3B
|Virtualization software    |VirtualBox 6.0.8
|RPi image                  |Raspbian Stretch lite

## Network Setup

The idea is to have 3 devices on the same network -

|Device         |Note                               |Address
|---            |---                                |---
|Host OS        |Provides a network adapter         |Dynamic
|Guest OS       |Taps to host OS network adapter    |192.168.1.1/24
|RPi            |Connected over ETH to host adapter |Dynamic

Dynamic addresses will be provided by the guest OS DHCP server.

## Served Directories

Directories served by the servers in the guest OS are -

|Server     |Served dir
|---        |---
|TFTP       |`/tftpboot`
|NFS        |`/nfs/rpi`

# Setup Procedure

Here is the overview of steps I did to bring up RPi to life over
network. Notes on particular steps are given below.

1.  I've used set up the VM, and installed fresh installation of
    Xubuntu, to make sure older modifications didn't mess up with
    performing the necessary configuration steps.
2.  Then, went through the setup steps for the servers as on [the guide
    page][nettut] mostly as they are written there.
3.  After that I've deployed and configured the image partitions also
    per information from [the guide page][nettut].
4.  Did RPi preparation also per info from [the guide page][nettut].
    Important note on the use of SD card in the corresponding chapter
    below.
5.  Cross fingers, and boot.

## VM Setup

Network adapter is attached to a bridged adapter, "Allow All"
promiscuous mode.

## Guest OS Setup

### Network Adapter Setup

I've configured the VM guest network adapter through Xubuntu's
`nm-connection-editor`. Here are the screenshots -

[TODO] - Provide smaller version

![3](/assets/images/posts/2019-07-12-rpi3-netboot/nm-connection-editor_3.png)

<!--
[TODO] - Add

#### Netplan

Other option would be to use the netplan. For that Networkd service
first have to be enabled -

```bash
$ sudo systemctl status systemd-networkd.service
$ sudo systemctl enable systemd-networkd.service
$ sudo systemctl start systemd-networkd.service
```

The netplan would look like this -

```bash
```

After adding it, run

```bash
$ sudo netplan apply
```

Then wait some time.

### NFS Server

Here's the content of the exports file -

```bash
marko@marko-VirtualBox:/$ cat /etc/exports 
/nfs/rpi 192.168.1.0/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)
```

And a check if it is mounted properly - 

```bash
marko@marko-VirtualBox:/$ showmount -e 192.168.1.1
Export list for 192.168.1.1:
/nfs/rpi 192.168.0.0/24
```

### Dnsmasq

The only uncommented part of `/etc/dnsmasq.conf` is -

```
listen-address=192.168.1.1
port=0
dhcp-range=192.168.1.100,192.168.1.250,12h
log-dhcp
enable-tftp
tftp-root=/tftpboot
pxe-service=0,"Raspberry Pi Boot"
```

### Serial Port

Picocom is used for serial console -

```bash
$ sudo apt install picocom
$ sudo usermod -a -G dialout $(whoami)
```

## Deploying Image Partitions

### Populating TFTP/NFS Mounted Directories

Important difference here is that I've transferred the files from the
image by mounting it inside the VM as a read-only, and then cp-ing, or
rsync-ing the files from its partitions to the TFTP/NFS mounting
directories.
    
For this, I've copied it first to the VM, then mounted it. Otherwise,
when mounted from the VM shared folder, file transfer was slow as hell,
and also unreliable (rsync had a tendency to freeze).

Here's the overview of commands to mount them -

```bash
$ sudo mount -t auto -o offset=50331648,ro ~/temp/2019-04-08-raspbian-stretch-lite.img /mnt/rpi/rfs
$ sudo mount -t auto -o offset=4194304,ro ~/temp/2019-04-08-raspbian-stretch-lite.img /mnt/rpi/boot
```

### Configuring Image

Changes made to the files are -

*   `/tftpboot/config.txt` - Appended it with `enable_uart=1`, to get
    the UART available.
*   `/tftpboot/cmdline.txt` - Updated NFS address to `192.168.1.1`.
*   Skipped SSH keys regeneration.
*   Also, don't forget editing of `/nfs/rpi/etc/fstab`!

## RPi Preparation

Had to set the OTP register 17 bit 29 to enable USB host booting. Did
that with the RPi image from a SD card. Useful info on the OTP found on
[this RPi page][otpbits], and info about the overall boot process
[here][bootflow].

After that, formatted card to one FAT32 partition, and copied
`bootcode.bin` from boot partition onto it. Otherwise, booting would
succeed like one in 10 times, if at all. More info in issues section.


## Running RPi with Network Boot

Useful tools for tracking the boot process are:

*   `# tcpdump -i <network-interface>` - Check for BOOTP request.
*   `# journalctl -f -u dnsmasq.service` - Check if files are TFTP-ed
    successfully.
*   `$ picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0` - Track overall boot process,
    esp. useful for NFS issues.

With RPi successfully booted, I was able to login over serial console.
After that, remaining step was to start SSH server, and check for the
given IP address -

```bash
$ sudo systemctl enable ssh.service
$ sudo systemctl start ssh.service
$ ip a show eth0
```

Then, all that was left was to SSH to the RPi, prod the home directory
and check if the changes appear in the served NFS directory on the guest
OS.

# Issues

Overall, network booting RPi seems like a tricky issue. [Network booting
page][nettut] states that -

>   There are a number of known problems with the Ethernet boot mode.
>   Since the implementation of the boot modes is in the chip itself,
>   there are no workarounds other than to use an SD card with just the
>   bootcode.bin file.

Particular issue where this workaround helps has been encountered, and
addressed below.

## RPi not Sending BOOTP Request

This issue appears when trying to boot RPi without a SD card. It is
visible when using `tcpdump`. Here's the snippet what is sniffed from
the network in this case -

```
marko@marko-VirtualBox:/tftpboot$ sudo tcpdump -i enp0s8 port bootpc
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on enp0s8, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
19:24:49.960758 IP 0.0.0.0.bootpc > 255.255.255.255.bootps: BOOTP/DHCP, Request from bc:ee:7b:9d:ab:ce (oui Unknown), length 322
19:24:49.964926 IP marko-VirtualBox.bootps > 192.168.1.221.bootpc: BOOTP/DHCP, Reply, length 306
```

The single BOOTP is from the host OS network adapter.

Here's how it should look like -

```
marko@marko-VirtualBox:/tftpboot$ sudo tcpdump -i enp0s8 port bootpc
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on enp0s8, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
19:25:52.123745 IP 0.0.0.0.bootpc > 255.255.255.255.bootps: BOOTP/DHCP, Request from bc:ee:7b:9d:ab:ce (oui Unknown), length 322
19:25:52.132651 IP marko-VirtualBox.bootps > 192.168.1.221.bootpc: BOOTP/DHCP, Reply, length 306
19:25:52.979730 IP 0.0.0.0.bootpc > 255.255.255.255.bootps: BOOTP/DHCP, Request from b8:27:eb:49:f5:8c (oui Unknown), length 322
19:25:52.981865 IP marko-VirtualBox.bootps > 192.168.1.204.bootpc: BOOTP/DHCP, Reply, length 350
```

The solution is to boot it with an SD card with one FAT32 partition, and
`bootcode.bin` from boot partition onto it. Other possible solution is
to increase `dhcp-reply-delay` option in the dnsmasq config file, but
that did not help me out, tried 1s and 3s delay.

Useful info on the issue can be found [in this forum post][bootcode].

## Buster Image Boot Freeze

At a time of this check new Raspbian image appeared -
`2019-06-20-raspbian-buster-lite.img`. Trying it out resulted in a
frozen boot some time after mounting NFS root. Here's the [forum
discussion on that topic][buster-boot-fail].
