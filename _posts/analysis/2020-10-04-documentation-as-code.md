## Overview

what is documentation as code, what are its implications and how it differs from traditional documentation

This is a take on describing what is Documentation as Code, what
characterizes it, and what are the relevant formats and tools.


## Documentation as Code

So, what is Documentation as Code? In general, Documentation as Code
(DaC) is an approach to treating the documentation process (writing,
reviewing, building, publishing) the same way as if it is the source
code.

What does this mean in practice? First, approach to documentation
process must adhere to certain prerequisites in order to be considered
DaC. These are that:

>   The documentation must be written in plaintext form suitable for
>   direct manipulation.

This means that in order to work with documents (write, read, compare),
it is enough to use any plaintext editor, without having the need for
specialized tools as a prerequisite to perform such operation (eg. use
of some viewer can facilitate performing the operation, but is not a
must).

>   There exists a CLI toolset that enables conversion of source
>   documentation files to the publishable form.

## Document Formats and Conversion Tools

Conversion tools are considered together with the formats, as the
formats are often specified through the converter tool.
