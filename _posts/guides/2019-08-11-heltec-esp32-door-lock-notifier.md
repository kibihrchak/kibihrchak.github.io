title:  "Heltec ESP32 Door Lock Notifier"

About a year ago I've bought 2 Heltec's ESP32 modules, and after
checking them out if they work put them in a drawer where they stayed
ever since. Thought it would be good to dust them off and give them a
try, especially that I haven't worked with Espressif microcontrollers
before.

After some initial research on the MCU/module, an idea came to me to
make as a mini learning project a door lock notifier. Ever once in a
while I have that "did I lock the door or not?" moment with the
apartment door, so that would be a good place to put the these modules
to use.

# ESP32

First, onto ESP32. In short, this is an MCU with 32b CPU and a whole
bunch of peripherals, most notably integrated WiFi/BT module. Quick
overview can be found on a [Wiki page][esp32-wiki].

Its predecessor was ESP8266, most notably known through
[NodeMcu][node-mcu]. For a comparison what has changed, there's a
[comparison with ESP8266][esp-comparison-table].

As for the ESP32-relevant information, the best repository is the
[esp32.net][esp32-net]. There you can find -

*   [Chip/module portfolio][esp32-hardware]
*   [How to do the development][esp32-development] - Arduino IDE,
    ESP-IDF

In addition to this, TRM can be found on the [Espressif official
webpage][esp32-trm].

## Heltec WiFi LoRa 32

Module that I have at hands is the [Heltec's WiFi LoRa 32
module][heltec-wifi-lora-32]. Here's how it looks live -

In addition to all the ESP32 goodies, it also incorporates the following
features, first and the last found to be useful for this project -

*   A small OLED display
*   SX1276/1278 LoRa chip
*   Lithium battery interface

Useful stuff on the module (pinout, schematics, lib examples) can be
found on Heltec repos -

*   [Schematics, pinouts, general libraries examples][module-resources]
*   [Module-specific examples][heltec-esp32-arduino-lib]

## (Arduino) IDE

Next, the question is regarding the IDE for ESP32 modules, which one can
be used. There are two reasonable options -

*   Using Heltec's ESP-IDF
*   Using Arduino IDE

I've went with the second option because it seemed as a faster way to
perform some quick prototyping. Here are some resources on setting up
the work environment -

*   [Arduino board, library setup][heltec-esp32-arduino-lib]
*   [How to use it from VSCode][arduino-vscode-extension]

# Door Lock Notifier

As for the mini project, the concept is following:

1.  Let the module somehow detect that the door has locked/unlocked.
2.  Upon detecting the change, connect to local Internet-enabled WiFi
    AP, through it to the IFTTT server, and send a POST request
    containing the update message.
3.  IFTTT will then using its Telegram bot generate a new message in the
    messenger.
4.  This message can then be observed via phone.

Here's an overview of the system components -

## Development Decisions

### Detect Door Lock/Unlock

First question that appeared was - How to detect door lock/unlock event?

The preferred way would be to use the movement of the lock deadbolt to
determine the transition between locked/unlocked state. This has a
benefit that the perceived state can quite certainly correspond to the
actual state.

As for detecting this transition, the straightforward way would be to
use a micro switch installed in the door frame, so that it gets closed
by a deadbolt going in the frame. But, the cheaper and faster option for
the prototyping purpose is to use the fact that deadbolts are made of
metal in order to be strong enough. Metal deadbolt, being conductive,
can itself serve as a part of a switch. Additional hardware would then
require just two additional leaf contacts leading to the used Heltec
board pins. Here's how it looks like from side -

### Connection to IFTTT Server

For connecting to the IFTTT server [WiFi Client example
sketch][wifi-sketch] has been used, spiced up with [the example on how
to do HTTPS connection][https-get-request].

### Module Autonomy

As the module is running on a battery, it would be preferable to lower
its power consumption so that it can operate for the extended period of
time. Of course, connecting it on an USB adapter would be the best
solution, but there were none close to the door and stretching the
cables over the wall wasn't an option.

Fortunately, ESP32 supports several power models, one of them being a
deep-sleep one, with -

*   ~6.5uA current consumption
*   RTC memory persistence
*   External wake-up source
*   And most importantly for fast prototyping, Arduino example sketch

So, the solution was to use the door lock detection switch as a wake-up
source, and set the wake-up level opposite of the last read out. [Deep
sleep Arduino example][deep-sleep-sketch] has been used as a basis for
it.

## System Components

### Notification Mechanism

Notification chain for IFTTT looks like -

1.  Set up web request with `esp32_reading` event name.
2.  Send message to Telegram private chat with IFTTT bot with following
    format:
    {% raw %}```
    What: {{EventName}}<br>
    When: {{OccurredAt}}<br>
    Door status: {{Value1}}<br>
    {% endraw %}```


### Notifier

Hardware outline is this -

1.  Connect Heltec board to battery and leaf-contact simulating wires.
2.  Use breadboard to hold everything together.

Here's how it looks like -

![hw-setup](/assets/posts/guides/2019-08-11-heltec-esp32-door-lock-notifier/hw-setup.jpg)

Here is the connection table for the used pins based on the [pinout
diagram][module-resources]:

|Pin            |Use
|---            |---
|GND            |Leaf wire 1
|0 (PRG button) |Leaf wire 2

As for the Arduino sketch, it's uploaded to the [GitHub
repo][sketch-repo].

## Results

Here's the live demonstration - [YouTube
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfEv6WS8OTA).

During the use, two main observed issues were:

1.  Sporadic triggering.
2.  Battery drain.
