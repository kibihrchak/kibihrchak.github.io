# Line Endings Configuration

Ok, this is a common topic but still worth reiterating. Basically, these
steps should help avoid line ending issues when cloning the repo, or
using text files in it.

1.  Set line ending conversion for commit/checkout:
    1.  (on Windows) Set `git config --global core.autocrlf true`, so
        that all checked out text files have CRLF newline.
    2.  (on other LF-using platforms) See that it is unset, or `false`,
        as these platforms do not require conversion from Git default LF
        line endings.
2.  Set repo configuration for files that should keep their line endings
    regardless of the platform (eg. Bash scripts when checked out on
    Windows, or Visual Studio project when checked out on Linux):
    1.  Create `.gitattributes` file in the root directory for files to
        be configured.
    2.  State expected line endings for required paths, eg. `*.sln text
        eol=crlf`.
3.  Renormalize line endings - `git add --renormalize .`.
