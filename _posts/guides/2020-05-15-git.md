# Line Endings Configuration

Ok, this is a common topic but still worth reiterating. Basically, these
steps should help avoid line ending issues when cloning the repo, or
using text files in it.

1.  Set line ending conversion for commit/checkout:
    1.  (on Windows) Set `core.autocrlf`, so that all checked out text
        files have CRLF newline -
        ```
        $ git config --global core.autocrlf true
        ```
    2.  (on other LF-using platforms) These platforms do not require
        conversion from Git default LF line endings, so:
        1.  See that `core.autocrlf` is unset or `false` as this option
            is intended for Windows use -
            ```
            $ git config --get core.autocrlf
            ```
        2.  In addition, check that `core.eol` is unset or `native` as
            we will be using native line endings -
            ```
            $ git config --get core.eol
            ```
2.  Set repo configuration for files that should keep their line endings
    regardless of the platform (eg. Bash scripts when checked out on
    Windows, or Visual Studio project when checked out on Linux):
    1.  Create `.gitattributes` file in the root directory for files to
        be configured.
    2.  State expected line endings for required paths, eg. `*.sln text
        eol=crlf`.
3.  Renormalize line endings, and commit renormalized endings (if there
    is any) -
    ```
    (repo)$ git add --renormalize .
    (repo)$ git commit -m "Renormalize line endings"
    ```
