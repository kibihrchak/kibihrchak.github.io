# Overview

Last week I've recalled that some month ago I've bought 2 Heltec's ESP32
modules, and after checking them out if they work put them in a drawer
where they stayed ever since. So, thought it would be good to dust them
off and give them a try, especially that I haven't worked with Espressif
microcontrollers before.

After some initial research on the MCU/module, an idea came to me to
make as a mini learning project a door lock notifier. Ever once in a
while I have that "did I leave the oven on?" moment with the apartment
door, so there would be a good place to try out the new module. [TODO]

# Door Lock Notifier [TODO]

As for the mini project, the concept is following:

1.  Let the module somehow detect that the door has locked/unlocked.
2.  Upon detecting the change, connect to local WiFi AP, then to the
    IFTTT server, and send a POST request containing the update message.
3.  IFTTT will then using its Telegram bot generate a new message in the
    messenger.
4.  This message can then be observed via phone.

Here's a schematic overview of the system components -

## Development Decisions [TODO]

### Detect Door Lock/Unlock

First question that appeared was - How to detect door lock/unlock event?

The preferred way would be to use the movement of the lock deadbolt to
determine the transition between locked/unlocked state. This has a
benefit that the perceived state can quite certainly correspond to the
actual state.

As for detecting this transition, the straightforward way would be to
use a micro switch installed in the door frame, so that it gets closed
by a deadbolt going in the frame. But, the cheaper and faster option for
the prototyping purpose is to use the fact that deadbolts are made of
metal in order to be strong enough. Metal deadbolt, being conductive,
can itself serve as a part of a switch. Additional hardware would then
require just two additional leaf contacts leading to the used Heltec
board pins.

### Connection to IFTTT Server

*   Connection over WiFi. [wifi-sketch]
*   HTTPS connection [https-get-request]

### Module Autonomy

As the module is running on a battery, it would be preferable to lower
its power consumption so that it can operate for the extended period of
time. Of course, connecting it on an USB adapter would be the best
solution, but there were none close to the door and stretching the
cables over the wall wasn't an option.

Fortunately, ESP32 supports several power models, one of them being a
deep-sleep one, with -

*   ~6.5uA current consumption
*   RTC memory persistence
*   External wake-up source
*   And most importantly for fast prototyping, Arduino example sketch

So, the solution was to use the door lock detection switch as a wake-up
source, and set the wake-up level opposite of the last read out.
